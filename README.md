# inet4031-lab4-website

This project was created for Lab 4 of INET 4031.  
It demonstrates how HTML and JavaScript can work together to make a simple interactive webpage.  
The page uses two buttons and two GIFs to turn a lightbulb on and off.  
I customized it by adding my name, changing the background color, and updating the text to make it my own version.
